== NAME

get_double - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns the equivalent double

== SYNOPSIS

*#include <cs50.h>*

*double get_double(string prompt);*

== DESCRIPTION

Prompts user for a line of text from standard input and returns the equivalent double as precisely as possible; if text does not represent a double or if value would cause underflow or overflow, user is prompted to retry.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns the equivalent double of the line read from stdin, as precisely as possible. If line can't be read, returns *DBL_MAX*.

== EXAMPLE

    // attempt to read double from stdin
    double d = get_double("Enter double: ");

    // ensure double was read
    if (d != DBL_MAX)
    {
        printf("You entered: %f\n", d);
    }
