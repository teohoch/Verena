== NAME

get_float - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns the equivalent float

== SYNOPSIS

*#include <cs50.h>*

*float get_float(string prompt);*

== DESCRIPTION

Prompts user for a line of text from standard input and returns the equivalent float as precisely as possible; if text does not represent a float or if value would cause underflow or overflow, user is prompted to retry.

== RETURN VALUE

Returns the equivalent float of the line read from stdin, as precisely as possible. If line can't be read, returns *FLT_MAX*.

== EXAMPLE

    // attempt to read float from stdin
    float f = get_float("Enter float: ");

    // ensure float was read
    if (f != FLT_MAX)
    {
        printf("You entered: %f\n", f);
    }
